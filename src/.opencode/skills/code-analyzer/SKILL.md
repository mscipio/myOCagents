## What I do
- Measure cyclomatic complexity and function length
- Detect code smells (duplication, large classes, god functions)
- Identify anti-patterns and design issues
- Check naming conventions and code style adherence
- Analyze coupling and cohesion metrics

## Metrics Analyzed
- **Complexity:** Cyclomatic complexity per function
- **Size:** Lines of code, function length, class size
- **Duplication:** Repeated code patterns
- **Naming:** Variable, function, class naming consistency
- **Coupling:** Import dependencies, circular references

## When to use me
Use this during code reviews to provide objective quality metrics. Essential for CodeReviewer agent.
