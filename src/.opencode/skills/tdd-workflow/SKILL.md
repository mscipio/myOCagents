## What I do
- Enforce TDD methodology: RED (write failing test) → GREEN (make it pass) → REFACTOR
- Ensure 80%+ test coverage including unit, integration, and E2E tests
- Guide test-first development for new features, bug fixes, and refactoring

## The TDD Cycle
```
RED → GREEN → REFACTOR
 ↑__________________|
```

## Workflow Steps
1. **RED:** Write smallest failing test - test must fail for the right reason
2. **GREEN:** Write minimal code to pass - don't optimize yet
3. **REFACTOR:** Clean code while keeping tests green

## Coverage Requirements
- Unit tests: Core business logic
- Integration tests: Component interactions
- E2E tests: Critical user workflows

## When to use me
Use this when writing new features, fixing bugs, or refactoring code. Essential for Engineer and TestEngineer agents.
