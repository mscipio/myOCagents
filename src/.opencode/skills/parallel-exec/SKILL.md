description: Concurrently dispatch multiple sub-agents for parallel task execution

## What I do
- Create isolated environments for multiple sub-agents simultaneously
- Distribute file scopes and context snippets to each agent
- Synchronize agent completion and aggregate results
- Detect and resolve merge conflicts when agents modify the same files

## When to use me
Use this when you have independent tasks that can run concurrently. Dramatically reduces execution time for multi-component features.
