description: Acceptance Test Driven Development with Given-When-Then syntax
compatibility: opencode
---

## What I do
- Guide acceptance test creation using Gherkin/Given-When-Then
- Bridge requirements and implementation
- Create executable specifications
- Ensure tests reflect user behavior

## Gherkin Syntax
```gherkin
Feature: Search functionality
  Scenario: User searches for a product
    Given the user is on the search page
    When they enter "laptop" in the search box
    Then they should see search results
```

## Structure
- **Given:** Preconditions and setup
- **When:** Actions and events
- **Then:** Expected outcomes

## Benefits
- Executable documentation
- Collaboration between stakeholders
- Living specifications
- Automated acceptance criteria

## When to use me
Use this for behavior-driven development. Essential for TestEngineer agent when creating integration/e2e tests.
