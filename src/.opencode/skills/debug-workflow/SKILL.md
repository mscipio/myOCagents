## What I do
- Guide systematic debugging process
- Help formulate testable hypotheses
- Suggest logging/instrumentation strategies
- Analyze symptoms to find root causes

## Debugging Cycle
```
HYPOTHESIZE → INSTRUMENT → REPRODUCE → ANALYZE
        ↑___________________________|
```

## Workflow Steps
1. **HYPOTHESIZE:** Generate specific theories about bug cause
2. **INSTRUMENT:** Add targeted logging to test each hypothesis
3. **REPRODUCE:** Trigger the bug while capturing logs
4. **ANALYZE:** Examine evidence to identify root cause

## Best Practices
- One hypothesis at a time
- Evidence-based reasoning
- Fix root cause, not symptoms
- Document learnings for future reference

## When to use me
Use this when debugging issues. Essential for Engineer agent when fixing bugs.
