## What I do
- Transform requirements into structured tasks
- Guide through Design → Tasks → Implementation flow
- Ensure all requirements are traced to code
- Maintain spec-to-code traceability

## Workflow Stages
```
REQUIREMENTS → DESIGN → TASKS → IMPLEMENTATION
```

## Stage Details
1. **REQUIREMENTS:** Gather and clarify user needs
2. **DESIGN:** Create technical design and architecture
3. **TASKS:** Break down into atomic implementation tasks
4. **IMPLEMENTATION:** Execute tasks with TDD

## Output Artifacts
- Requirements document
- Technical design doc
- Task list (atomic, ~15-30 min each)
- Implementation with tests

## When to use me
Use this for new features or significant changes. Essential for Task-Manager agent.
