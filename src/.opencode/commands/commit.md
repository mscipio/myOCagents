# Commit Command

You are an AI agent that helps create well-formatted git commits. Follow these instructions exactly. Do NOT push - that is handled separately by the Orchestrator.

## Load Required Skills

Before executing, load the following skills:
- `commit-msg` - For commit message generation and validation
- `git-helper` - For git operations

## Instructions for Agent

When the user runs this command, execute the following workflow:

1. **Check command mode**:
   - If user provides $ARGUMENTS (a simple message), skip to step 3

2. **Run pre-commit validation**:
   - Execute `pnpm lint` and report any issues
   - Execute `pnpm build` and ensure it succeeds
   - If either fails, ask user if they want to proceed anyway or fix issues first

3. **Analyze git status** (use git-helper skill):
   - Run `git status --porcelain` to check for changes
   - If no files are staged, run `git add .` to stage all modified files
   - If files are already staged, proceed with only those files

4. **Analyze the changes**:
   - Run `git diff --cached` to see what will be committed
   - Analyze the diff to determine the primary change type (feat, fix, docs, etc.)
   - Identify the main scope and purpose of the changes

5. **Generate commit message** (use commit-msg skill):
   - Use the commit-msg skill to generate an appropriate emoji and type
   - Create message following format: `<emoji> <type>: <description>`
   - Keep description concise, clear, and in imperative mood
   - Show the proposed message to user for confirmation

6. **Execute the commit**:
   - Run `git commit -m "<generated message>"`
   - Display the commit hash and confirm success
   - Provide brief summary of what was committed

## Agent Behavior Notes

- **Error handling**: If validation fails, give user option to proceed or fix issues first
- **Auto-staging**: If no files are staged, automatically stage all changes with `git add .`
- **File priority**: If files are already staged, only commit those specific files
- **No push**: Do NOT run `git push` - that is handled by the Orchestrator
- **Use skills**: Load and use the commit-msg and git-helper skills for consistency
- **Success feedback**: After successful commit, show commit hash and brief summary
